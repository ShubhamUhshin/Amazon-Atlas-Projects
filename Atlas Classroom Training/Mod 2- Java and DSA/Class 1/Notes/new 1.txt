	Introduction
		Computer->

					Accuracy
		
		Programming Language
			PL is a language to interact with computer by creating a program.
			To solve a problem
		
		Where which PL?
			OS-> C/C++
			Desktop/Mobile App-> Java, Python, C++
			Web App-> Java, Python, JavaScript
			ML and AI-> Python
			Data Analysis-> Python, R
			Backend-> Java
			
	Java Introduction
		JDK-> Java Development Kit (It consists of compiler, Run Time Environment and more tools for developers to write and execute programs in java.)
				https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/install/installation-jdk-microsoft-windows-platforms.html#GUID-DAF345BA-B3E7-4CF2-B87A-B6662D691840
				
		IDE-> Eclipse IDE, IntelliJ, Visual Studio Code
		
		replet.com -> Online IDE
		
		History
			Originally was named as OAK, made by James Gosling.
			He saw an OAK tree outside and named it.
			He loved coffee, which was first found on an island known as Java.
			He loved coffee, so the symbol.
			Released by Sun Microsystems.
			
		Software Development Architecture
			SW is a piece of program which can be run on a computer.
			
			Model [Data Structures] -> Storage | Space Complexity
				Data | Storage Container
					Source Location, destination location, type, 
					
			View [User Experience | UX] -> Screen/Visuals 
				UI
					Visual INterface i.e. Screen | Input Fields, Maps, Button etc
			
			Controller [Algorithms] -> Time | Time Complexity
				Logic

		JAVA
			JAVA Program and Compilation Process
				Source (Source Code) -> Processing -> Result
				Orange					Juicer		  Orange Juice
		Features Of Java
			Easy
			Robust- If there is an error in code, compiler will track it. If there are errors, Java will handle it (Example: Net disconnects, rather than app crashing, it says no internet)
			Portable- WORA
			Distributed-Multiple uses, multithreading
			Object Oriented-A way to store data
			Platform Independent- Write Oncce Run everywhere (WORA)
			Secure
			Interpret
			Multithreaded
			
			
		JVM
			Java Virtual Machine. It is an abstract machine, does not exist physically. 
			Provides a runtime environment.
			Converts source code into byte code.
			
			Ref IMG2
				
		JVM vs JRE vs JDK
			JDK
				It has 
					compiler, which is accessible with command known as javac
					Libraries
					Java Runtime Environment (JRE) which is Java Virtual Machine.
						JRE are libraries.
						
					Java Virtual Machine
						has 3 components
							Class Loader
							ByteCode Verifier
							JIT Compiler
							
					When we install JVM, JRE also gets installed		
			
					Compile Time Environment (CTE)
					Run Time Environment	 (RTE)
					IMG3
					
					
		JDK is the component used to compile, debug and execute the code.
		
		Object class is the superclass of every class in Java.

		DataTypes in JAVA
		MODEL -> Storage containers
		
			-Single Value Container
				Primitive DataTypes
					Integral
					Floating
					Character
					Logical
					
			-Multi Value Container
				Reference DataTypes
					String
					Arrays
					Objects
					Dynamic Data Structures

			Operators
			Conditional Constructs
			Iterators
