					-Bridge
					-Adapter
					-Composite
					-Proxy
					-FlyWeight
					-Facade
					-Decorator
					
					Bridge
						It decouples an abstraction from it's implementations so that the two can vary independencies.
						i.e. It works on eliminating the dependency.
						
						Inheritance has straight filled arrow whereas interface has dotted arrows.
						
						
					Composite Pattern
					
					
					
					Decorator
						Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
						Can provide a flexibility
						
					Facade
						
						
					FlyWeight
						Uses sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.
						
					Proxy
						Provides a placeholder, i.e. an object to use in the place of other object to access some function.
