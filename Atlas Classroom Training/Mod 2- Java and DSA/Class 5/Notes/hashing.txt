Class 5
	Data Structures
	
		Set
			It has unique value.
			
		HashSet
			It is important because of it's time complexity.
			Insert/Add, Search/contains, Delete/Remove has time complexity of O(1).
			CREATION
				HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<>(); // Same as ArrayList
				
			INSERT
				set.add(value); //Duplicate value not allowed.
				//add is also a function in arraylist.
				
			SEARCh
				set.contains(value) //It returns true or false

		Hash Table
			Reduces time complexity.
			Data Structure that offers very fast insertion and searching, almost O(1).
			Relatively easy to program as compared to trees.
			Based on arrays, hence difficult to expand.
			No convenient way to visit the items in a hash table in any kind of order.
			
		Hashing
			A range of key values can be 
			
			
			
			
			
		Wrapper Class	
			For every primitive data type, we have a wrapper class in Java.
			For instance,
				int age = 0;
				Integer age = Integer.valueOf(10);
				Integer age = 20;
