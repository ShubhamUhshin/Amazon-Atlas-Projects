Assignment 1:
Time limit: 30 minutes

Problem Statement:
	Write a Java Program which will do the below functionalities:
		a. Implement Command Design Pattern for solving this problem.
			Refer this example for understanding:
			https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/command-design-pattern
	
		b. We need to build a remote control for home automation system which shall control different lights/electrical units of the home. A single button in remote may be able to perform same operation on similar devices e.g. a TV ON/OFF button can be used to turn ON/OFF different TV set in different rooms.

		c. Implement the below classes and interfaces to solve the above problem:

			1. ICommand interface which is the command interface
			2. Light is one of a receiver component. It can accept multiple commands related to Light like turn on and off.
			3. Fan is also another type of a receiver component. It can accept multiple commands related to Fan like turn on and off.
			4. HomeAutomationRemote is the invoker object, which asks the command to carry out the request. Here Fan on/off, Light on/off.
			5. StartFanCommand,StopFanCommand,TurnOffLightCommand,TurnOnLightCommand etc. are different type of command implementations.

	d. Write a client program to test the above written code.

Assignment 2:
Time limit: 30 minutes

Problem Statement:
	Write a Java Program which will do the below functionalities:

		a. Implement Facade Design Pattern for solving this problem.
			Refer this example for understanding:
			https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/facade-design-pattern-in-java

		b. Let’s consider a hotel. This hotel has a hotel keeper. There are a lot of restaurants inside the hotel e.g. Veg restaurants, Non-Veg restaurants, and Veg/Non Both restaurants.

		c. You, as a client want access to different menus of different restaurants. You do not know what are the different menus they have. You just have access to a hotel keeper who knows his hotel well.

		d. Whichever menu you want, you tell the hotel keeper and he takes it out of the respective restaurants and hands it over to you.

		e. Here, the hotel keeper acts as the facade, as he hides the complexities of the system hotel.

		f. Implement the below classes and interfaces to solve the above problem:

			1. Hotel Interface
			2. NonVegRestaurant class
			3. VegRestaurant class
			4. VegNonBothRestaurant class
			5. HotelKeeper Interface
			6. Both class
			7. HotelKeeperImplementation class

		g. Write a client program to test the above written code.

			5. HotelKeeper Interface
			6. Both class
			7. HotelKeeperImplementation class

		g. Write a client program to test the above written code.
