	- Array
			+ Single Dimension
			+ 2d / Multi Dimension
		- Stack
		- Queue
			+ Single Queue
			+ Circular Queue
			+ Dequeue
			
		- Linked List
			+ Singly Linked List
			+ Doubly Linked List
			
			
	- Array 
		Collection of similar datatypes.
		Index -> 0
		Fixed Length
		int a[]; int[] a
		int a[] = new int [10];
		int a[] ={5,10,15}; -> 15 -index 2;
		a.length -> 3
		for (int i =0; i< a.length; i++) -> index out of bound exception
		
		-Searching
			+Linear Searching -> It linearly compares each element of array with search element
				Works on both sorted and unsorted array.
				Consumes more time since it checks with every element.
				
				Refer searching.java
				
			+Binary Search
				Works on sorted array.
				Comparetively faster (than linear search)
	
				Divide the array in two parts -> Finding the middle
				Check searchElement, whether greater than middle or less than or equal to.
				
				Refer binarySearch.java
				Refer binarySearchDryRun.txt
