		  Types of Sorting: 
			+ Bubble Sort
			+ Selection Sort
			+ Insertion Sort

			+ Bubble Sort
				It compares adjacent elements.
				The largest element (while arranging in ascending order) is sent to it's position(last index) at first followed by second largest and so on.
				It has the time complexity of O(n^2).
				
			+ Selection Sort
				It compares the whole array with the element of the 1st index and finds the index of the smallest element in the array.
				Then it swaps the 1st element with the smallest element followed by the second and so on.
