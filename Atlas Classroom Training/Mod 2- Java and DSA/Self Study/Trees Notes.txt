Trees
	
	BFS
	DFS
		DFS (Depth-first search) is a technique used for traversing trees or graphs. 
		Here backtracking is used for traversal. In this traversal first, the deepest 
		node is visited and then backtracks to its parent node if no sibling of that 
		node exists.
		DFS
			Depth First Search/Traversal
			In Order
				Traverse the left subtree, i.e., call Inorder(left-subtree)
				Visit the root
				Traverse the right subtree, i.e., call Inorder(right-subtree)
				Answer for Fig- 3 2 4 1 6 5
			
			Pre Order -		
				Visit the root
				Traverse the left subtree, i.e., call Preorder(left-subtree)
				Traverse the right subtree, i.e., call Preorder(right-subtree)	
				Time Complexity - O(n)
				Space Complexity - O(n)

			Post Order -
				Traverse the left subtree, i.e., call Postorder(left-subtree)
				Traverse the right subtree, i.e., call Postorder(right-subtree)
				Visit the root
				Postorder traversal is used to delete the tree
				Postorder traversal is also useful to get the postfix expression of an expression tree
