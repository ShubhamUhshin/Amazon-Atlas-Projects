Day4 - Sorting
		+ Insertion Sort
			Adaptive Sorting
			Efficient for smaller arrays
			
			
	Stack
		LIFO(Last In First Out) principle
		Insertion (Push) and deletion(pop) happens from the same end (Top).
		
		
	Queue
		FIFO (First In First Out) principle
		Insertion happens at the rear end and deletion happens at the front end.
		
		Linear Queue
			If the front end is empty but rear has reached the end of the Queue, it shows queue is full, even though there is empty 
			space in the beginning of the queue.
			This is the drawback of linear queue, which is why we have circular queue.
		
		Circular Queue
			If the rear and front reaches the end of the queue, the front and rear becomes 0.
