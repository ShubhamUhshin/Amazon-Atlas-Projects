Defect Reporting:
======================

Error:
========
A human action that produces an incorrect result. If someone
makes an error or mistake in using the software, this may lead
directly to a problem - the software is used incorrectly and so does
not behave as we expected.

Defect:
=============
A flaw in a component or system that can cause the
component or system to fail to perform its required functions are
called Defects or sometimes Bugs or Faults

Failure:
===========
A defect, if encountered during execution, may cause a
failure of the component or system. When the software code has
been built, it is executed and then any defects may cause the system
to fail to do what it should do (or do something it shouldn't), causing
a Failure. Not all defects result in failures; some stay dormant in the
code and we may never notice them.

What is Defect:
=================

An incorrect or incomplete implementation of the functionality mentioned
in the requirement specification document (FS or Use case)

A missing functionality mentioned in the requirement specification
document (FS or Use case)

Any deviation made in the screen layout from that mentioned in the GUI
Standards document

Nonconformance to the requirements mentioned in the requirement
specification document (FS or Use case)

A defect is therefore anything that, alters the program's ability in a
negative sense, to completely and effectively meet the user's /
client’s requirement.

What is not Defect:
====================
Any suggestion / observation logged by the tester.

Any functionality that is expected by the tester but not mentioned in
the requirements specification document (FS or Use case)

This could be an enhancement


When is defects are found:
==============================

A defect is found in the following phases of the Project Life Cycle:

Requirements Definition - Defining the requirements that meets the needs of
the organization / client

Design - Design to accomplish the defined requirements

Coding - Programs to accomplish the defined requirements and design

Unit Testing - Testing done by the developer for each piece of code
individually

Integration Testing - Testing done by the testing team while integrating the
modules into the system

System Testing - Testing done by the testing team taking the entire system
into consideration

Acceptance Testing - Testing done by the Client before accepting the
product delivered

Defects found during unit, integration , system testing and acceptance
testing are called as Application defects.

How to write a defect:
==============================
While writing a defect the following details must be taken care:

Defect must be written concurrent with or immediately following test
execution

Describe the entire scenario that led to the defect.

Attachment of the screen shot must be provided (if applicable)

Language clarity must be taken care of

Ambiguous statements should be avoided.

Data used for testing (if applicable)

Trace the defect to the requirement mentioned in the requirement
specification document (if applicable)

How to not write a defect:
=================================
A defect must not be written as follows:

Describing the defect without the entire scenario

Describing the defect without clarity in the language used

Describing the defect without the evidence

Defects found during requirements definition, design and coding phase
are called Review comments.

Defect Severity and Priority:
======================================
Severity - The severity of a defect is the impact of the defect on the software.

The severity classification is as follows:

Critical: The defect affects critical functionality or critical data. It does not have a
workaround. Example: Unsuccessful installation, complete failure of a feature.

Major: The defect affects major functionality or major data. It has a workaround but is not
obvious and is difficult. Example: A feature is not functional from one module but the task is
doable if 10 complicated indirect steps are followed in another module/s.

Minor: The defect affects minor functionality or non-critical data. It has an easy workaround.
Example: A minor feature that is not functional in one module but the same task is easily
doable from another module.

Cosmetic: The defect does not affect functionality or data. It does not even need a
workaround. It does not impact productivity or efficiency. It is merely an inconvenience.
Example: Petty layout discrepancies, spelling/grammatical errors

Priority - Priority of the defect indicates the importance and order in which the defect
should be fixed.

The priority classification is as follows:

Urgent: Must be fixed in the next build.

High: Must be fixed in any of the upcoming builds but should be included in the release.

Medium: May be fixed after the release / in the next release.

Low: May or may not be fixed at all.

Defect LifeCycle:
======================
The defect that is recorded goes through the following state:

Open - Initially when the defect is logged

Assigned - When is assigned to the developer for fixing the defect

Resolved - When the developer has fixed the defect

Retest - Tester is retesting the defect after the fix

Re-Open - When the defect is re-tested and found that it still persists.

Closed - When the defect is re-tested and found that it is fixed.

Rejected - When the defect is invalid.

Defect Report:
===================
What is a Defect Report ? Why do we write them?

Defect report is a technical document

Describes failure mode in system under test (SUT)

The only tangible “product” of testing

Written to increase product quality

Documents a specific quality problem quality of SUT

Communicates to developers

Structured testing foundational to good defect reports

Use deliberate, careful approach to testing.

Follow written test cases or run automated ones per written or
standardized process

Defect reporting begins when expected and observed results differ

Defect Tracking System:
========================
Defects are everywhere! How do you keep track of them and ensure
that the bugs get fixed?

Defect Tracking:
=======================

Tracking all the defects found in each phase of the project life cycle to
ensure that it is tracked to closure i.e. either fixed or rejected with
reason

Defect Tracking/Management System:
====================================

A software into which all the defects found in different phases of the
software life cycle are logged and tracked to closure

Ensures that the final product is in compliance with the defined
requirements

Ensures that the defect with the Severity and Priority gets fixed based
on the criticality.

Defect tracking tools:
==========================
HP ALM
JIRA
Bugzilla
Rally


Example:
=================

Summary:
==============
Email field is not accepting numerical values.

Description:
================
Email field in the log in page is not accepting numberical values, it's accepting
only alphabets and special charaters.

Env: Dev1

Data: abc@gmail.com

Steps to Reproduce:
=====================
1) Log into xyz application
2) Enter the email id value with numbers

Actual Result:
===============
Numbers are not accepted in the email field

Expected Result:
====================
Numbers must be accepted in the email field.

Attachment: Screenshots

Severity: High



Password setting rules:
============================
1 upper case
1 lower case
Special character
1 numerical
Total 8 characters


Defect Raising Steps:
======================
Summary: Password is getting accepted even though it doesnt met the password setting criteria.



Description:
===================
When the password is been changed, its getting accepted eventhoug the password setting criterias are not met.

Env: Dev2
Data: saranya@gmail.com
Password: abcdef12

Steps to Reproduce:
======================
1) Naviagte to Facebook sign up page
2) Enter the First Name and Last Name
3) Enter the email id or phone number
4) Enter the New Password which diesn't meet the critera
5) Select the DOB
6) Select the Gender
7) Click on Sign up button

Actual Result:
================
The user id is created

Expected Result:
===================
New Password field should throw an inline error message.

Severity: High
