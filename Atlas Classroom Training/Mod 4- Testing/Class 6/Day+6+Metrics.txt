Metrics:
============
Process Metrics:
==================
We use this on the process of test preparation and test
execution phase of STLC.

Test Case Preparation Productiity
Test Design Coverage
Test Execution Productivity
Test Execution Coverage
Test Cases Passed
Test Cases Failed
Test Cases Blocked


Test Case Preparation Productvity:
=====================================
Calculate the number of test cases prepared and the efftort 
spent on the test case preparation.

Formula:
===========
Test Case Preparation Productvity = No of test cases / Effort spent for test case preparation

Eg: No of test cases = 240
Effort spent on test case creation (hours) = 10 hours

Test Case Preparation Productvity =240/10 == 24 test cases/hour


Test Design Coverage:
===================
It helps to measure the percentage of test cases coverage against the
number of requirements.

Formula:
================
Test Design Covergae= Total no of requirements mapped to test cases
                      ---------------------------------------------- * 100
                      Total no of requirements 
Eg:
========

Total no of requirements = 100

Total no of requirement mapped to the test cases = 98

Test Design Coverage = 98/100  * 100 == 98%


 
Test Execution Productivity:
================================
It determines the number of test cases that can be executed in an hour



Formula:
===========
Test Execution Productivity = No of test cases executed
                             -------------------------------
                              Effort spent for execution of test cases

Eg:
=====
No of test cases executed = 180
Effort spent for execution of test cases = 10

Test Execution Productivity = 180/10 == 18 test cases / hour



Test Execution Coverage:
============================
To measure the number of test cases executed against number of test cases planned.

Formula:
===========
Test Execution COverage -== Total No of test cases executed 
                            -------------------------------- --------- * 100  
                             Total No of test cases planned to execute

 

 Eg:
======
Total No of test cases planned to execute = 240
Total No of test cases executed  = 160

Test Execution Coverage = 180/240 * 100 ======== 75%
      



Test Case Passed :
======================
To measure the percentage no of test cases are passed

Formula: 
Test Case passed = Total no of test cases passed  
                  --------------------------------- * 100
                   Total no of test cases executed 


Eg:
====
Total no of test cases passed = 80
Total no of test cases executed = 90
 
Test cases passed = 80/90 * 100 ====88.8 == 89%


Test Cases Failed:
=================
To measure the percentage no of test cases are failed

Formula: 
Test Case passed = Total no of test cases failee
                  --------------------------------- * 100
                  Total no of test cases executed 



Eg:
====
Total no of test cases failed = 10
Total no of test cases executed = 90
 
Test cases passed = 10/90 * 100 ==== 11.2 %  == 11%


Test Case Blocked:
==================
It is to measure the percentage no of test cases blocked



Formula:
==========
Total no of test cases blocked
-------------------------------- * 100
Total no of test cases executed

Eg:
=====
Total no of test cases blocked = 5
Total no of test cases executed = 90

Test cases blocked = 5/90 * 100 ====6 %



Product Metrics:
================
It is used in the process of defect analysis phase of STLC.


During the defect analysis phases of STLC, we do generate








Error Discovery Rate
Defect Fix Rate
Defect Density
Defect Leakage
Defect Removal Efficiency





Error Discovery Rate:
=========================
To determine the effectiveness of the test cases.

Formula:
================
Total No of defects found
-------------------------------- * 100
Total No of test cases executed 



Eg:
------
Total no of test cases executed = 240
Total No of defects found = 60
Error Discovery rate = 60/240 * 100 == 25% 


Defect Fix Rate:
==================
It helps to know the quality of a build in terms of defect fixing.


Formuala:
==========

Total No of defects reported as fixed - Total No of defects reopened 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------  * 100
Total no of defects reported as fixed + Total No of new bugs due to fix


Eg:
======
Total no of defects reported as fixed == 10
Total no of defects reopned ============ 2
Total no of new bugs due to fix  ======= 1

Defect fix rate == (10 -2)
                   ------- * 100  ===== 8/11 * 100 ==== 72.7 %  -- 73%
                    (10+1)           



Defect Density:
==================
It os defined as the ratio of defects to the requirements.

Formula:
================
Total no of defects identified
-------------------------------
Actual requirements size 

Eg:
====
Total no of defects identified = 80
Actual requirements size = 10

Defect Density = 80/10  === 8





Defect Leakage:
===============
It is used to review the efficiency of the testing process before UAT.

Total no of defects found in UAT
------------------------------------- * 100
Total no of defects found before UAT



Eg:
======
No of defects found in UAT = 20
No of defects found before UAT = 120

Defect Leakage == 20/120 * 100 === 16.5%


Defect Removal Efficiency:
===================================
It allows to compare overall (pre and post release/delivery) defect removal efficiency.

Total no of defects found pre-release
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- *100
(Total no of defects found in pre release +Total No of defects found in post release)



Eg:
==========
Total no of defects found in pre release = 80
Total no of defects found in post release = 10

Defect Removal effiiceinecy = 80
                              ------ * 100  === 80/90 * 100 === 89 %
                              80+10
